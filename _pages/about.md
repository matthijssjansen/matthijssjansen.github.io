I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://atlarge-research.com/">Massivizing Computer Systems research group</a>, part of the <a href="https://www.vucompsys.net/">Computer Systems Section</a> of the <a href="https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science">Computer Science Department</a> at <a href="https://vu.nl/en">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a>.

My research focuses on resource provisioning, management, and offloading in the compute continuum. Within the <a href="https://github.com/atlarge-research/continuum">Continuum framework</a>, I study how we can simplify resource provisioning in heterogeneous cloud-edge-endpoint environments, speed up application deployment via configuration management, and leverage this toward rapid design-space exploration of application deployments within the compute continuum.

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract    = {Today, machine learning (ML) workloads are nearly ubiquitous. Over the past decade, much effort has been put into making ML model-training fast and efficient, e.g., by proposing new ML frameworks (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch), leveraging hardware support (TPUs, GPUs, FPGAs), and implementing new execution models (pipelines, distributed training). Matching this trend, considerable effort has also been put into performance analysis tools focusing on ML model-training. However, as we identify in this work, ML model training rarely happens in isolation and is instead one step in a larger ML workflow. Therefore, it is surprising that there exists no performance analysis tool that covers the entire life-cycle of ML workflows. Addressing this large conceptual gap, we envision in this work a holistic performance analysis tool for ML workflows. We analyze the state-of-practice and the state-of-the-art, presenting quantitative evidence about the performance of existing performance tools. We formulate our vision for holistic performance analysis of ML workflows along four design pillars: a unified execution model, lightweight collection of performance data, efficient data aggregation and presentation, and close integration in ML systems. Finally, we propose first steps towards implementing our vision as GradeML, a holistic performance analysis tool for ML workflows. Our preliminary work and experiments are open source at https://github.com/atlarge-research/grademl.},

  abstract    = {Extending human societies into virtual space through the construction of a metaverse has been a long-term challenge in both industry and academia. Achieving this challenge is now closer than ever due to advances in computer systems, facilitating large-scale online platforms such as Minecraft and Roblox that fulfill an increasing number of societal needs, and extended reality (XR) hardware, which provides users with state-of-the-art immersive experiences. For a metaverse to succeed, we argue that all involved systems must provide consistently good performance. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the performance characteristics of extended reality devices. In this paper, we address this gap and focus on extended- and virtual-reality hardware. We synthesize a user-centered system model that models common deployments of XR hardware and their trade-offs. Based on this model, we design and conduct real-world experiments with Meta's flagship virtual reality device, the Quest Pro. We highlight two surprising results from our findings which show that (i) under our workload, the battery drains 15% faster when using wireless offloading compared to local execution, and (ii) the outdated 2.4 GHz WiFi4 gives surprisingly good performance, with 99% of samples achieving a frame rate of at least 65 Hz, compared to the 72 Hz performance target.
